# ZendCon 2016 - Introduction to Graph Databases with Neo4j

Slides, code examples, and reference materials for my Introduction to Graph Databases with Neo4j talk at ZendCon 2016.

~~## Cypher Instructions~~

~~1. Download and install [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/download/) Community Edition.
~~1. Start Neo4j and navigate to [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) and follow the prompts.~~
~~1. Open your browser's `localStorage` and replace the contents of `neo4j.documents` with [this](localStorage/neo4j.documents) and `neo4j.folders` with [this](localStorage/neo4j.folders).~~
~~    * You can access your browser's localStorage using the Resources or Storage tab of your browser's Developer tools.~~
~~1. Refresh the page, and the demo folders and favorites will be available in the Neo4j browser Favorites.~~

~~If you can't get that to work, you can also just copy and paste the queries from [ecommerce.cql](ecommerce.cql) and [seven-bridges.cql](seven-bridges.cql).~~

~~## PHP Instructions~~

~~1. `cd examples/php` and run `composer install`~~
~~1. Run `php neo4j-client-example.php` or `php neo4j-ogm-example.php`~~

## Examples

The libraries in these examples, and Neo4j itself, have changed over time. Please refer to my
[Lone Star PHP 2017](../lonestar2017/intro-to-graph-databases-with-neo4j) talk on this topic for up to date examples.

The slides for my original ZendCon 2016 talk have been preserved in this repository for posterity.
