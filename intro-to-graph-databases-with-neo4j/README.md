# SunshinePHP 2016 - Introduction to Graph Databases with Neo4j

Slides, code examples, and reference materials for my Introduction to Graph Databases with Neo4j talk at SunshinePHP 2016.

## Cypher Demo Instructions

1. Download and install [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/download/) Community Edition.
1. Start Neo4j and navigate to [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) and follow the prompts.
1. Open your browser's `localStorage` and replace the contents of `neo4j.documents` with [this](localStorage/neo4j.documents) and `neo4j.folders` with [this](localStorage/neo4j.folders).
    * You can access your browser's localStorage using the Resources or Storage tab of your browser's Developer tools.
1. Refresh the page, and the demo folders and favorites will be available in the Neo4j browser Favorites.

If you can't get that to work, you can also just copy and paste the queries from [ecommerce.cql](ecommerce.cql) and [seven-bridges.cql](seven-bridges.cql).
